Documentation
=============

This repository is the start of the re-writing of LUNAR (https://github.com/CMMRLab/LUNAR), to allow
LUNAR's abilities to be easily scriptable in Python and allow for quicker and easier generation of
documentation using doc strings and sphinx. This repository will eventually be added to PyPi, but 
during the initial development will be used as a locally installed version using pip.

Add your content using ``reStructuredText`` syntax. See the
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
documentation for details.
